# Leaflet-Challenge -  Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This task is to visualize an earthquake data set.


The dataset was obtained from USGS as it provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Hte data was presented in JSON representation.


# Import & Visualize the Data
A map was created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.


Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Popups are included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
